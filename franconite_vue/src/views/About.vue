    <h1>What you should know...</h1>
    <p>It's sacrilege, I know, but I've recently switched all of my dev tools, OS themes, and anything else with a dark-mode toggle back to light-mode. I think it's important to get that out in the open straight away. I collect more board games than I can realistically get around to playing, and I drink more coffee than is natural.</p>
    <p>My favorite projects are ones that bring multiple layers of software interaction together. Command and Control Servers, specifically ones that command distributed hardware, are something I'm always looking to dive deeper into. Also anything graphics or image processing related.</p>
